/**
 * Leetcode 621. Task Scheduler
 * <p>
 * You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n.
 * Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order,
 * but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
 * <p>
 * â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
 * <p>
 * Output: 8
 * <p>
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
 * <p>
 * After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
